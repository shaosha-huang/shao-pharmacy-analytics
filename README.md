## 🗄️ Data Structure & Initial Checks

Shao's Pharmacy's database consists of **three main tables** with a total of **X** records.  
Here’s a description of each table:

- **customers:** Demographic and subscription info for each customer.
- **products:** Product catalog, pricing, and prescription status.
- **orders:** Transactional table linking customers and products, with order details and fulfillment info.

### Entity Relationship Diagram

Below is the ERD in Mermaid format.  
**Tip:** GitHub now natively renders Mermaid diagrams in Markdown preview. If you view locally, VS Code with a Mermaid extension will also work.

    }
```

**Note:**  
If column names are showing up cut off in your repo, it's likely because of line length or the Mermaid renderer.  
- Try placing each column on its own line, as above.
- Ensure there are no trailing spaces or tabs.
- If you still see truncation, consider using a PNG image export of the ERD for a flawless display.
