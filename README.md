## Project Overview

Hi! I created this project to showcase my ability to work across the data pipeline: generating realistic sample data with Python, using SQL to extract and transform information, and building dashboards that deliver actionable business insights.  
For this project, I focused on four dashboard perspectives that are especially valuable for a real-world team:

- **Customer Segmentation Dashboard:** Understand who your best customers are, their behaviors, and how segmentation impacts retention and growth.
- **Product Performance Dashboard:** Track top-selling products, seasonal trends, and the impact of promotions or prescription requirements.
- **Operations & Satisfaction Dashboard:** Monitor shipping delays, fulfillment bottlenecks, and customer feedback‚Äîenabling data-driven improvements in service.
- **Revenue Forecast Dashboard:** Project future monthly revenue, visualize trends, and communicate forecast confidence to support planning and growth.

Together, these dashboards demonstrate how technical skills can translate directly into business impact, supporting teams across marketing, product, operations, and finance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions and Caveats

- **Assumption 1:** All customer state codes are valid US states.
- **Assumption 2:** Doctor names for prescription orders may be unformatted and require SQL cleaning.
- **Assumption 3:** Some fields (e.g., email, manufacturer) are synthetically generated and not real.
- **Assumption 4:** Data for certain months may be sparser due to simulated business cycles.
- **Assumption 5:** Revenue forecasts are based on historical order data, monthly trend factors, and may have variable confidence scores.
