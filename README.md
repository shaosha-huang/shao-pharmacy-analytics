## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions and Caveats

_Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These are noted below:_

- **Assumption 1:** (e.g., missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
- **Assumption 2:** (e.g., data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
- **Assumption 3:** (e.g., because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
